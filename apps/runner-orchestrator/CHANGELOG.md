# runner-orchestrator

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#121](https://github.com/TutlyLabs/Tutly/pull/121) [`68030af`](https://github.com/TutlyLabs/Tutly/commit/68030afa9d6820a19acb14f204236cadccff8db7) Thanks [@UdaySagar-Git](https://github.com/UdaySagar-Git)! - Replace the Jest + jsdom autoeval runner with a Playwright-driven container that boots the same Sandpack bundler the editor uses. Tests now execute byte-identically to what the student sees in the preview, eliminating the "passes in editor, fails in autoeval" class of bugs (structuredClone, fetch, spec-strict spread, jsdom shims, etc.). New image: `ghcr.io/tutlylabs/tutly-browser-runner`. Per-job memory bumped to 640 MB to fit Chromium + bundler + headroom.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#115](https://github.com/TutlyLabs/Tutly/pull/115) [`71095b2`](https://github.com/TutlyLabs/Tutly/commit/71095b2bb6cfc63ee5547543af99a577ecb635eb) Thanks [@UdaySagar-Git](https://github.com/UdaySagar-Git)! - Test runtime: swap jsdom→happy-dom and ts-jest→babel-jest (loose mode) so autoeval matches Sandpack's in-browser preview. Fixes `structuredClone is not defined`, `fetch not available`, and spec-strict spread errors for code that passes in the editor.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#113](https://github.com/TutlyLabs/Tutly/pull/113) [`e6e3690`](https://github.com/TutlyLabs/Tutly/commit/e6e36909eee80bf7db445b330884d78e264d77d2) Thanks [@UdaySagar-Git](https://github.com/UdaySagar-Git)! - Server-side Jest test runner for SANDBOX assignments.

  - new `runner-orchestrator` worker runs each student submission in a locked-down `tutly-jest-runner` container (--network=none, memory/cpu/pids caps, no-new-privileges, cap-drop=ALL)
  - visible tests run in-browser as before for fast feedback; submit now also enqueues a `SubmissionTestRun` that the orchestrator picks up via `/api/test-runner/claim` and reports back via `/api/test-runner/callback` with an HMAC service token
  - instructors author hidden tests in a new "Hidden Tests" dialog in the sandbox editor; files live in `Attachment.hiddenTestFiles` and never reach the student
  - admin dashboard gets live status badge, per-row "Rerun tests" and "View report" buttons, and a top-bar "Rerun all submissions" action (instructor-only, 5-minute soft rate limit)
  - mentor dashboard shows per-student tests passed/failed counts
  - student view shows aggregate-only counts until the assignment deadline; visible-test failures unlock after the deadline; hidden tests never leak to students
  - schema additions: `Attachment.hiddenTestFiles`, `SubmissionTestRun.jestReport / errorMessage / attempt / triggeredByUserId`, index `(assignmentId, createdAt)`
  - new GH Action `deploy-runner-orchestrator-production.yml` builds both images and pings Coolify
